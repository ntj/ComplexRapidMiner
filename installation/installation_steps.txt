1. Install NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/, version 2.18 of July 1st, 2006)
2. Add NSIS installation directory to your path
3. Copy the Java Runtime Environment into a directory "jre" (strip it down, see below)
4. Run ant target "release-windows-installer"


* For edit (and creation) of NSIS scripts with Eclipse:

(plugin)

* Stripping down Runtime Environment (JRE):

Checkout Readme.txt in the JRE directory. This file describes the necessary files. 
For example, JRE 1.5.0_06 can be stripped as follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Required vs. Optional Files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------  
The files that make up the J2SE Runtime Environment are divided into 
two categories: required and optional.  Optional files may be excluded 
from redistributions of the J2SE Runtime Environment at the 
licensee's discretion.  

The following section contains a list of the files and directories that 
may optionally be omitted from redistributions with the J2SE Runtime 
Environment.  All files not in these lists of optional files must be 
included in redistributions of the runtime environment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Files and Directories
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following files may be optionally excluded from redistributions.
These files are located in the jre1.5.0_<version> directory, where
<version> is the update version number.  Solaris and Linux filenames
and separators are shown. Windows executables have the ".exe" suffix.
Corresponding files with _g in name can also be excluded.

lib/charsets.jar                  
   Character conversion classes
lib/ext/ 
   sunjce_provider.jar - the SunJCE provider for Java 
     Cryptography APIs
   localedata.jar - contains many of the resources 
     needed for non US English locales
   ldapsec.jar - contains security features supported 
     by the LDAP service provider
   dnsns.jar - for the InetAddress wrapper of JNDI DNS provider
bin/rmid
   Java RMI Activation System Daemon
bin/rmiregistry

When redistributing the JRE on Microsoft Windows as a private
application runtime (not accessible by other applications)
with a custom launcher, the following files are also
optional.  These are libraries and executables that are used 
for Java support in Internet Explorer and Mozilla family browsers; 
these files are not needed in a private JRE redistribution.

Redistributable JDK(TM) Files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The limited set of files from the JDK listed below may be included in 
vendor redistributions of the J2SE Runtime Environment.  All paths 
are relative to the top-level directory of the JDK.

 - jre/lib/cmm/PYCC.pf
      Color profile.  This file is required only if one wishes to 
      convert between the PYCC color space and another color space.

 - All .ttf font files in the jre/lib/fonts directory. Note that the 
   LucidaSansRegular.ttf font is already contained in the J2SE
   Runtime Environment, so there is no need to bring that file over 
   from the JDK. 

 - jre/lib/audio/soundbank.gm
      This MIDI soundbank is present in the JDK, but it has 
      been removed from the J2SE Runtime Environment in order to 
      reduce the size of the Runtime Environment's download bundle. 
      However, a soundbank file is necessary for MIDI playback, and 
      therefore the JDK's soundbank.gm file may be included in 
      redistributions of the Runtime Environment at the vendor's 
      discretion. Several versions of enhanced MIDI soundbanks are 
      available from the Java Sound web site: 
      http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/
      These alternative soundbanks may be included in redistributions 
      of the J2SE Runtime Environment.

  - The javac bytecode compiler, consisting of the following files:
        bin/javac           [Solaris(TM) Operating System 
                             and Linux]
        bin/sparcv9/javac   [Solaris Operating System 
                             (SPARC(R) Platform Edition)]
	bin/amd64/javac     [Solaris Operating System (AMD)]
        bin/javac.exe       [Microsoft Windows]
        lib/tools.jar       [All platforms] 

 - The Annotation Processing Tool, consisting of the following files:
        bin/apt             [Solaris(TM) Operating System
                             and Linux]
        bin/sparcv9/apt     [Solaris Operating System
                             (SPARC(R) Platform Edition)]
	bin/amd64/apt       [Solaris Operating System (AMD)]
        bin/apt.exe         [Microsoft Windows] 

  - jre\bin\server\
       On Microsoft Windows platforms, the JDK includes both 
       the Java HotSpot Server VM and Java HotSpot Client VM.  However, 
       the J2SE Runtime Environment for Microsoft Windows platforms 
       includes only the Java HotSpot Client VM. Those wishing to use 
       the Java HotSpot Server VM with the J2SE Runtime Environment 
       may copy the JDK's jre\bin\server folder to a bin\server 
       directory in the J2SE Runtime Environment. Software vendors may 
       redistribute the Java HotSpot Server VM with their 
       redistributions of the J2SE Runtime Environment.  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography Extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to import control restrictions for some countries, the Java 
Cryptography Extension (JCE) policy files shipped with the J2SE 
Development Kit and the J2SE Runtime Environment allow strong but 
limited cryptography to be used.  These files are located at

     <java-home>/lib/security/local_policy.jar
     <java-home>/lib/security/US_export_policy.jar

where <java-home> is the jre directory of the JDK or the 
top-level directory of the J2SE Runtime Environment.

An unlimited strength version of these files indicating no restrictions 
on cryptographic strengths is available on the JDK web site for 
those living in eligible countries.  Those living in eligible countries 
may download the unlimited strength version and replace the strong 
cryptography jar files with the unlimited strength files.

Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
An endorsed standard is a Java API defined through a standards
process other than the Java Community Process(SM) (JCP(SM)). Because
endorsed standards are defined outside the JCP, it is anticipated that
such standards will be revised between releases of the Java 2 
Platform.  In order to take advantage of new revisions to endorsed 
standards, developers and software vendors may use the Endorsed 
Standards Override Mechanism to provide newer versions of an endorsed 
standard than those included in the Java 2 Platform as released by Sun
Microsystems.

For more information on the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism, 
including the list of platform packages that it may be used to 
override, see

   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/standards/

Classes in the packages listed on that web page may be replaced only 
by classes implementing a more recent version of the API as defined 
by the appropriate standards body.

In addition to the packages listed in the document at the above 
URL, which are part of the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition 
(J2SE(TM)) specification, redistributors of Sun's J2SE 
Reference Implementation are allowed to override classes whose 
sole purpose is to implement the functionality provided by 
public APIs defined in these Endorsed Standards packages.  
Redistributors may also override classes in the org.w3c.dom.* 
packages, or other classes whose sole purpose is to implement 
these APIs.

The cacerts Certificates File
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Root CA certificates may be added to or removed from the J2SE
certificate file located at <java-home>/lib/security/cacerts.
For more information, see The cacerts Certificates File section
in the keytool documentation at:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html#cacerts
