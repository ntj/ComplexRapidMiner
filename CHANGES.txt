    the same type was created)
  
  * Allow complete data scan for value type guessing now
    in ExampleSource configuration wizard

     - Use default GUI properties in cases where loading of
       properties did not work

        should be started via "java -jar yale.jar" which did 
        no longer work without defining the property 
        yale.home. Should be fixed now
      - Additional performance criteria were not stored in XML
      - Added missing close statements for database handling,
        prevent errors if already closed   
      - Fixed bug during statistics calculation if a column
        only contains missing values
      - Exception was thrown by feature binary generators if 
        the generated value was NaN or infinite
      - Fixed LibSVM model application bug for high class 
        skews

      - PsoSVM
      - EvolutionaryFeatureAggregation
      - PlattScaling
      - SplitChain

  * All operator chains now define conditions which must be
    fulfilled by inner operators.

  * New model concept: models which are used for prediction 
    purposes (prediction models) can now be combined with
    models for preprocessing, e.g. a z-transformation model.
    This allows for fairer evaluations without using information
    about the training data which might have been collected 
    during preprocessing.

  * Preprocessing models, e.g. a normalization model can be applied
    with the same parameters on the test set

  * Improved Operator Info Screen (F1) which now also shows
    conditions for inner operators. This eases experiment design
    for new users

  * PerformanceEvaluator adds new criteria to input 
    performance vectors now

  * Evolutionary feature operators supports multiobjective
    optimization now

  * Feature operators now allow an arbitrary number of 
    inner operators

  * Added new VectorGraphics package (freehep) version 1.2.2

  * New Weka version 3.5.2 (current CVS version of Weka)
 
  * The attribute type "string" of Weka is now also supported

  * Renamed two parameters of SparseFormatExampleSource: 
    "attributes" is now called "attribute_description_file",
    "attribute_file" is now called "data_file"

  * AUC as a parameter of PerformanceEvaluator instead of 
    ThresholdFinder

  * ExampleSetWriter now resolves the relative path of the
    data file

  * Tutorial now reflects the development since Yale 3.0

  * More example filter types for ExampleFilter operator

  * Added filters for Data View

  * Added parameter sample_ratio to example source operators

  * Speed up of experiments by preventing IO logging if
    not necessary

  * GUI does not hang any longer after stopping an 
    experiment and a message is shown that the current
    operator will be finalized

  * all regression performance criteria can now handle nominal
    labels regarding the confidence for the desired true class

  * relative_absolute_error now renamed to 
    normalized_absolute_error

  * Implementation Details:
      - YALE is now completely type safe, i.e. no warnings
        occur by compiling with Xlint:unchecked
      - Population operators now work on objects of class
        Individual instead of directly working on 
        AttributeWeightedExampleSets
      - Added method getSpecialAttribute(String) to 
        ExampleSet interface. This allows a faster retrieval
        of special attributes
      - UndefinedParameterError will be thrown if an 
        operator asks for the value of a non-optional
        parameter with no default value and no user 
        defined value
      - The abstract method checkIO of OperatorChain was 
        replaced by getInnerOperatorCondition()
      - Removed deprecated method initApply()
      - added new check method performAdditionalChecks()
      - reworked package structure for feature operators
      - improved memory management for BayesianBoosting
      - Replaced method getValue() of averagables (like
        performance criteria) by getMikroAverage(). 
        Operators should use getAverage() which returns
        the makro average if possible and the mikro 
        average otherwise

  * Bugfixes:
      - Update of Data View did not properly work
      - ThresholdApplier did not properly overwrite the
        crisp predictions
      - error in root mean squared error calculation for
        data sets with different sizes
      - wrong plotting of threshold values in ROC curves
      - new operator was not properly selected after replacing
        an operator via the context menu. Therefore the old
        parameters were not removed in the GUI
      - LibSVM used Math.random() and was therefore not 
        deterministic
      - Replace " by &quot; in XML parameter descriptions
      - In some cases the variance of a performance 
        criteria became negative. Fixed now.
      - Bug in RemoveUselessAttributes since attribute stats
        were not longer calculated


Changes from Yale 3.0 to Yale 3.1 [2005/11/22]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * New operators:
      - IOMultiplier
      - PerformanceLoader
      - T-Test
      - Anova
      - DataStatistics (usefull only for command line, see 
        implementation details)

  * Removed operators:
      - old parameter based Weka operators (were deprecated)
      - MultipleLabelLearner and 
        MultipleLabelPerformanceEvaluator (please use
        MultipleLabelIterator instead)

  * Drastically reduced runtime (see implementation details)

  * Improved attribute editor (added views on data, 
    load series data, icons, nicer error messages)

  * Binary classification performance criteria mark the
    positive class

  * Predict confidences for both binominal and polynominal 
    classifications tasks

  * Confidences are now automatically set after applying 
    a classification model for all learners, the parameter 
    use_distribution is therefore not longer supported

  * ExampleSetWriter can also write prediction confidences
    now. The dense data format and the special format was
    slightly adapted to reflect this change

  * Attribute ranges can also be specified in meta data view

  * Splitted default noise of NoiseOperator in label_noise
    and default_attribute_noise

  * New Weka version 3.4.6 integrated

  * Nicer error messages for many data reading problems

  * IteratingPerformanceAverage can now handle all types of
    averagable vectors and also more than one inner 
    performance vectors

  * The Yale color plotter shows now a legend with a mapping
    of the colors to the values for these colors. This also
    applies for the scatter plot based on the color plotter

  * Sanity checks before learning if the used learner can
    learn from the given data set (using the predefined 
    learner capabilities)

  * Uses (p) for initialization probability of feature 
    selection algorithms instead of (1-p)

  * The counter for the automatic creation of attribute names
    is resetted before an experiment will be started

  * A new breakpoint type for breakpoints in operator apply
    loops

  * CSVExampleSource now uses the first line for attribute 
    names

  * Implementation Details:
      - The position of the Weka Jar file can now be defined
        via an environment variable WEKA_JAR
      - Removed the construction of attribute weights from 
        example if this is not necessary (this drastically 
        decreases the desired time for example constructions)
      - Improved the calculation of example set statistics
      - Removed the recalculation of attribute statistics
        after data changes. Statistics are now only calculated
        if they are needed (including display purposes in the 
        graphical user interface)
      - Attribute is an interface now, different classes of 
        attributes introduced. As a consequence attributes,
        can only be constructed with help of the 
        AttributeFactory class
      - Added a FastExample2SparseTransform class which
        provides methods for fast sparse representation
        creation, especially for SparseArrayDataRows
      - Removed check if an attribute is already part of an
        example set before it is added. This also improves
        runtime
      - FilteredExampleSet is now called ConditionedExampleSet
      - Failing during operator initialization (during start up) 
        does not prevent loading the following operators any 
        longer

  * Bugfixes:
      - Bugs in SparseArrayDataRow
      - Copy of IOContainer was shallow. This bug might have lead 
        to a wrong parameter optimization behavior for complex
        feature selection experiments
      - Implemented missing method in ConditionedExampleSet
      - Fixed size bug in ConditionedExampleSet
      - Key strokes for cut, copy, and paste did not work 
      - Syntax highlighting for description tag did not work
      - Opening a new experiment kills experiment thread now
      - Saving of settings did not always work
      - Changing from XML view to other views caused empty 
        status bar
      - Error in change detection after modifying the 
        experiment in XML view
      - Range update in data view did not work for two changes
        at the same time


Changes from Yale 2.4.1 to Yale 3.0 [2005/07/11]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * New operators: 
      - FeatureNameFilter (using regular expressions)
      - FeatureValueTypeFilter (replaces FeatureTypeFilter)
      - FeatureBlockTypeFilter
      - operators for all Weka tasks instead of specifying 
        the Weka operator with a parameter (see below)
      - MultipleLabelLearning
      - MultipleLabelPerformanceEvaluator
      - MultipleLabelIterator
      - AverageBuilder
      - RenameAttribute (renaming and type changing)
      - Data generators for testing purposes
      - MinMaxWrapper for linear combinations of average and
        minimum values (which might lead to more stable 
        optimizations)
      - CorrelationMatrix (which can also produce feature 
        weights)
      - SimpleBinDiscretization
      - SimpleFrequencyDiscretization
      - Single2Series
      - PerformanceWriter (in addition to the ResultWriter)
      - ParameterCloner
      - ParameterSetWriter
      - GridParameterOptimization (replaces old ParameterOpt.)
      - NelderMeadParameterOptimization
      - PatternParameterOptimization
      - ParameterIteration (which simply iterates through 
        given parameter combinations instead of optimize them)
      - IOConsumer (consumes unused outputs)
      - ARFFWriter
      - WrapperXValidation (replaces old MethodXValidation)
      - SimpleWrapperValidation (replaces old 
        SimpleMethodValidation)
      - NominalExampleSetGenerator
      - JViToPlotter (additional to build in plotters)

  * Removed operators: 
      - The external operators for the C versions of MySVM, 
        SVMLight, and C45 are not longer part of the Yale 
        core. Please use the Java implementations JMySVM, 
        LibSVM, and J48
      - LegalNumberExampleFilter was replaced by the 
        operator ExampleFilter. This operator can handle both
        missing values and user defined value conditions
      - MethodXValidation was replaced by WrapperXValidation.
        The old operator was not able to handle mere feature 
        weighting methods additional to selection
      - ParameterOptimization (see above). In addition, the 
        parameter parameter_file was removed from all 
        parameter optimization operators
      - SimpleMethodValidation (see above)
      - FeatureTypeFilter was replaced by an improved 
        FeatureValueTypeFilter
      - BatchedValidationChain

  * Improved data management and statistics. Yale can handle 
    larger data sets now

  * Undo and Redo function

  * Several new performance criteria including MinMaxCriterion
    for weighted linear combinations of the minimum and 
    the average of arbitrary criteria

  * Some operators are deprecated now. Deprecated operators
    provide messages during application and validation and
    should not longer be used

  * New plotter concept, introducing Yale color plotter, 
    GnuPlotPlotter for 3D plots, scatter plots, and 
    distribution plotter (histograms). Plots are only 
    automatically created for smaller data sets (settings)

  * In addition to the new plotter concept the operator 
    JViToPlotter can be used to plot some of the IOObjects
    of Yale. The current version at least supports ExampleSet
    and some numerical models

  * Syntax highlighting in message viewer and XML editor,
    colors can be specified in the preferences dialog

  * New Weka version 3.4.5 integrated

  * New LibSVM version 2.8 integrated

  * Generic operator classes and operator sub types. This
    allows the building of generic operators with one class
    for several operators. This feature is used for the new 
    Weka operator style where each learning scheme matches
    one Yale operator (and not a parameter of an operator)

  * Added Learner Capabilities. Each learning scheme can now
    define which type of data set is supported by the learner

  * Added stratified sampling for cross validation on data
    with a categorical label. This ensures that the subsets 
    provide the same class distribution than the whole data 
    set

  * Added several additional selection and crossover schemes 
    for evolutionary feature operators. 

  * Learners and performance evaluators can now deliver
    the input example set as output if this is desired.
    This also applies for models and ModelApplier.
 
  * New structure of settings dialog

  * (Optional) Tip of the Day at startup

  * Automatical update check during start-up (once in a month,
    no personal data is transmitted or collected).

  * Command line version waits at breakpoints and can be
    resumed by pressing enter

  * Only a user defined amount of lines will be logged,
    the default is 1000. This value can be changed in the
    settings dialog

  * Since massive logging may slow down experiments the
    default log verbosity for new experiments is "init"

  * Removed some verbosity levels which were not frequently
    used

  * Plugins can also provide a GenericOperatorFactory in their
    operator description file which can be used to register 
    additional generic operators
 
  * Improved operator group structure in GUI and package 
    structure

  * Improved Javadoc documentation, at least all classes 
    should have a class comment
 
  * Learners cannot write the model directly into a file any
    longer. Please use the operator ModelWriter for this
    purpose.
 
  * Implementation details:
     - ATTENTION: Since operators should know their own 
       operator description the usage of the empty operator
       constructor is not longer allowed. Operators must be 
       created with 
            OperatorService.createOperator(String name)
       The usage of empty operator constructors is not longer 
       allowed for operator creation!
     - Using Arff loader from Weka instead of KDB package
     - Changed the method name getIdAttribute() to getId() 
       in ExampleSet, some methods from Example were removed
     - Added a copy method to Parameters
     - It is now possible to query examples by their id
     - It is also possible to query examples by their index.
       This is only recommended for memory based example 
       tables and should not be used for iteration purposes.
       Each operator which must iterate through complete 
       example sets should use ExampleReaders. However,
       this change allows Yale to construct Weka instances
       on the fly which drastically decreases memory usage
     - Operators can now define the default behavior for 
       input consumption and a parameter will be 
       automatically defined and queried. This allows that
       some operators (like validation chains or performance
       evaluators) can pass their input (the example set
       for example) to the following operators
     - Added two helper methods getDeliveredOutputClasses()
       and getAllOutputClasses(Class[] innerOutput). One
       of these methods should be used to return the 
       delivered output of an operator chain at the end of
       checkIO(). These methods reflect the consumation
       behaviour changes. Please refer to the Yale tutorial
       for further informations.
     - The implementation of the simple feature selection
       operators was improved. The memory usage is reduced
       especially in case of forward selection
     - SparseArrayDataRows need less memory than 
       SparseMapDataRows with the same runtime. This
       datamanagement type should be used if data is 
       sparser than 50%
     - Using sparse array data rows after Nominal2Binary 
       filtering

  * Bugfixes: 
    - bug in unix start scripts (plugins were not properly 
      loaded)
    - variance adaption in feature weighting
    - wrong conversion from Weka instances to Yale example 
      sets for data sets with more attributes than examples
    - Bug in average handling of validation operators mixed 
      up weights and performance values for some feature 
      operation experiments
    - strange plotting of some example sets
    - validation of experiments containing disabled 
      operators
    - fixed bug in database handling which prevents feature
      selection to work correctly on example sets based on 
      databases (csv and dBase too)



Changes from Yale 2.4 to Yale 2.4.1 [2004/10/08]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * New operators: 
      - RandomOptimization

  * New Weka version 3.4.3 integrated

  * The Unix start scripts guess the location for YALE_HOME 
    depending on the location of the script

  * Bugfix: The performance which was delivered by validation 
    chains (only for plotting purposes) was not the average 
    but the last performance. This error was the reason for
    a wrong plot in the ParameterOptimization sample 
    experiment


Changes from Yale 2.3.3 to Yale 2.4 [2004/09/20]
------------------------------------------------------------

      - C45ExampleSource
      - Obfuscator,
      - Deobfuscator
      - CorpusBasedWeighting

  * Removed operators: UPGMAClusterer and WekaClusterer are 
    now part of the Clustering plugin

  * Changed operators: the former implementation of 
    DecisionTreeLearner was removed since it was not able to
    produce pruned decision trees. The internal representation
    of Weka's J48 learner which was formerly known as Y45Learner
    is now named DecisionTreeLearner.
 
  * Splitting of KDBExampleSource operator in four operators
    which individually load ARFF, csv, bibtex, and dBase 
    files. 

  * The parameter "mean_variance_scaling" of the 
    normalization operator is no longer of type category but
    of type boolean.

  * The parameter $v[name] of the special format of 
    ExampleSetWriter can now be used for both regular and
    special attributes

  * accuracy and classification error are now calculated for
    both binary and multiclass problems. Additionally the 
    confusion matrix is displayed.

  * ThresholdFinder can deliver AUC (area under the ROC curve).
    The maximum number of ROC-points which are plotted is 
    limited to 200.

  * All results are presented with the same number of digits

  * Forward selection (FeatureSelectionOperator) initially
    checks if the used attribute are useless, i.e. all values
    are equal, before it creates a new example set based on 
    this attribute.

  * Validation chains which split example sets recalculate
    the attribute statistics. Therefore for each iteration
    one data scan is performed. These additional costs are
    paid to clearify the values and eases the usage of inner
    operators which make use of the statistics
 
  * Implementation details: 
      - recalculation of attribute statistics can be done 
        directly with a method from example set now instead 
        of the example table
      - The method initApply() of operator is now deprecated
      - The method getSpecialAttribute(String) of ExampleSet 
        was removed. Use getAttribute(String) for both regular 
        and special attributes.

  * Bugfix: 
      - data writing of the experiment log operator at the end 
        of the experiment
      - statistics plot is removed at the beginning of a new 
        experiment
      - Y45Learner (now named DecisionTreeLearner) did not 
        allow to create unpruned trees
      - newline at the end of data files can now be omitted
    
  
Changes from Yale 2.3.2 to Yale 2.3.3 [2004/08/20]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * New operators: 
      - IteratingOperatorChain

  * Some new target functions for the ExampleSetGenerator
 
  * With %b the apply count value plus 1 can be asked in a
    parameter string (%b% will be resolved to %a + 1)

  * Bayesian Boosting now supports internal bootstrapping and
    provides the performance values to plot them with the
    experiment log operator

  * Weka models are now displayed in the message viewer and
    log files

  * Allow environment variable definition of the maximal used
    memory in Windows start scripts (like the unix scripts)

  * Some tutorial additions

  * Bugfix: 
      - Exception in toString() of tree
      - wrong command line construction for C45Learner
      - bug in status bar which increases CPU usage (low 
        priority) and does not show the correct operator
      - removal of nominal attributes in feature selection 
        experiments


Changes from Yale 2.3.1 to Yale 2.3.2 [2004/07/12]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * New operators: 
      - ExampleSetGenerator

  * Weighted mutation can be bounded between 0 and 1.

  * Scaling of the ROC curve plotted by the threshold
    finding operator. 

  * Bugfix: 
      - Internal change of representation for nominal 
        attribute values. This guarantees the same order for
        nominal values when writing a attribute description 
        file and reloading it.


Changes from Yale 2.3 to Yale 2.3.1 [2004/07/08]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * New operators: 
      - Sampling
      - BayesianBoosting
      - ThresholdFinder
      - ThresholdApplier
      - ExampleVisualizer
    
  * Examples with Id can now be displayed from the plotter
    by double clicking the example. Therefore a 
    ExampleVisualization operator must have been added.

  * Pressing the delete key removes the selected operator
    from the operator tree 

  * Bugfixes:
     - Settings dialog displays correct default values at
       startup.


Changes from Yale 2.2 to Yale 2.3 [2004/06/22]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * New operators: 
      - AttributeValueMapping
      - AverageLearner
      - LearnerFeatureGeneration (to create attributes from the
        predictions of different learning schemes)
      - RemoveUselessAttributes

  * Removed operators: 
      - ExampleSetInfo (use RemoveUselessAttributes instead)
      - ModelContainerLearner (use LearnerFeatureGeneration)
      - Concept Drift operators (in plugin now)

  * New online Tutorial available in help menu

  * Zooming functionality for all 2D plotters. Simply drag 
    a rectangle to zoom into the selected region. Right 
    clicking sets the range to maximum size.

  * Added user descriptions (comments) which can be edited 
    in the operator info screen (F1). The description of the
    root operator is shown after loading an experiment. This
    can be set disabled in the settings dialog.

  * Expert and Beginner modes added. In expert mode all 
    parameters are shown. In the beginner mode only important
    parameters.
 
  * Save as Template added. Experiments which were saved as
    template can be used by the wizard.

  * Using the LearnerFeatureGeneration produces a new example 
    set containing the model predictions as attributes.
    Another learning scheme can be used to learn from this 
    values a meta model. Alternatively the new AverageLearner 
    can simply calculate the average of the predictions which 
    is especially useful in a selection or weighting wrapper.

  * Implementation details: 
      - new packages in operator and learner packages

  * Bugfixes: 
      - FixedSplitValidationChain delivered not the defined 
        absolute number of examples
      - Problems with classification tasks and Weka learners
        due to Weka's new internal representation.


Changes from Yale 2.1.1 to Yale 2.2 [2004/06/01]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * New operators: 
      - AttributeSetLoader (instead of FeatureGenerationOperator)
      - ModelWriter
      - Y45
      - WekaMetaLearner
      - ModelContainerLearner
      - NoiseOperator
      - FourierTransform
      - Java versions of MySVM and MyKLR

  * AttributeSetWriter uses new format:
            name::construction_description
    This change was necessary to allow the weighting of 
    attributes after loading and constructing them 

  * Operators can now be disabled

  * Weighting vector of JMySVM now delivered for linear 
    kernels. JMySVM can also deliver xi alpha estimation
    of performance now

  * Interface Learner added, former learner super class is 
    now abstract

  * Weka independent internal implementation of J48 added
    for own adaptions

  * Weka meta learning schemes can be designed in two ways: 
    With the known WekaLearner operator and by specifying 
    parameters and, now, by specifying them as operator 
    chains. This allows the same representation for all 
    Yale meta learning schemes with internal learning 
    operators as children

  * Meta learner schemes can be used to create new attributes
    from the predictions of learned models

  * new system for objects which can be averaged like 
    performance criteria or weights

  * example sets are displayed in table view or plot view, the 
    same applies for models of JMySVM learners

  * Bugfixes: 
      - Exception in unbalanced crossover
      - unused IO objects will not longer be doubled by the 
        usage of simple operator chains


Changes from Yale 2.1 to Yale 2.1.1 [2004/04/16]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * Weka version 3.4.1 included. Since many of the learners 
    are now part of a new package, it might be necessary to 
    adapt the weka class names in your experimentfiles. 

  * YaleIdMapping included. May be part of example sets in
    future releases.

  * Breakpoints are now saved.


Changes from Yale 2.0.3 to Yale 2.1 [2003/12/17]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * New operators: 
     - IdTagging
     - InfiniteValueReplenishment
     - InteractiveFeatureWeighting
     - AttributeWeightsWriter
     - AttributeWeightsLoader
     - AttributeWeightsApplier for different weight functions
     - Attribute2RealValues
     - AttributeWeightSelection

  * Support for Word Vector Tool, Value Series Preprocessing, 
    and Clustering plugin

  * The definition of a label attribute in cases where the
    data contains no label but should get a predicted one is
    no longer necessary

  * attribute selection is now seen as attribute weighting 
    which allows more flexible operators. Feature operators
    like forward selection, genetic algorithms and the 
    weighting operators can now deliver an example set with
    the selection / weighting already applied or the original
    example set (optional). Therefore all feature operators
    delivers the new IO object "AttributeWeights", not only
    the weighting ones. A weight of 0 means, that the attribute
    should be deselected

  * more than one additional operator description file can be 
    specified with the -Dyale.operators.additional option by 
    using the system dependant path separator (e.g. ":" on 
    Unix systems)
  
  * Settings dialog

  * Bugfixes:
    - cut and paste bug fixed
    - sometimes data columns and headers in attribute editor did
      not match. Fixed.

Changes from Yale 2.0.2 to Yale 2.0.3 [2003/12/17]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * Added parameter additional_performance_criteria to
    PerformanceEvaluator for specifying user-defined performance 
    criteria

Changes from Yale 2.0.1 to Yale 2.0.2 [2003/11/20]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * Error estimation for MultiClassLearnerByRegression

  * Bugfixes:
    - Attribute editor combo box did not respond to attribute 
      type changes

Changes from Yale 2.0 to Yale 2.0.1 [2003/10/22]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * New operators:
      - MultiClassLearnerByRegression

  * %-expansion in parameter values: 
      %a replaced by number of times, the operator was applied
      %t replaced by current system time
      %n replaced by name of operator
      %c replaced by class of operator

  * "Replace operator" context menu added

  * Replaced kxml by Java XML parsers

  * Removed DirectedGeneratingGeneticAlgorithm (DGGA)

  * Bugfixes:
      - GUI used to hang when stopping experiment at breakpoint

Changes from Yale 2.0 beta 2 to Yale 2.0 [2003/08/28]
------------------------------------------------------------

  * New operators: 
      - DefaultLearner
      - WekaAssociationLearner
      - QuadraticParameterOptimization
      - GNUPlotOperator
      - ConceptDriftAdaptor
      - ForwardWeighting
      - EvolutionaryWeighting
      - UPGMA (tree clusterer)
      - BatchedValidationChain
      - ExampleSetInformation

  * Added attribute weighting

  * Added plugin support.

  * SVMLearner does not automatically remove NaN examples. (This
    feature was actually never documented). Use ExampleFilter to
    remove NaNs instead. 

  * Added gnuplot support for GUI; added GNUPlotOperator

  * Operator 'ConceptDriftAdaptor' added for experiments where the data 
    used for a classification task has a concept drift in the concept
    to be learned. While the concept drifts in experiments performed
    with the 'ConceptDriftSimulator' are artificially simulated, the
    'ConceptDriftAdaptor' handles data with real concept drift (and
    does not generate any additional artificial drift).

  * Allowed arbitrary names for special attributes.


Changes from Yale 2.0 beta to Yale 2.0 beta 2 [2003/06/18]
----------------------------------------------------------

  * Operators for concept drift simulation experiments and
    several time window management and example weighting
    approaches were added (see operators "ConceptDriftSimulator",
    "BatchWindowLearner", "BatchWeightLearner").

  * Renamed global experiment parameter 'keep_temp_files' to
    'delete_temp_files'.

  * LegalNumberExampleFilter replaced by more general operator 
    ExampleFilter. By implementing ConditionExampleReader.Condition
    users can specify arbitrary conditions.

  * SparseFormatExampleSource: New parameter "attributes" allows
    for an attribute description file similar to the ExampleSource.
    If the old behaviour is desired, the parameter "format" must be
    set to "separate_file".

  * DatabaseExampleSource: Separate query file replaced by new
    parameters ("username", "databasename", ...). In case of long
    queries the query (and only the query) can still be read from a
    separate file (still specified by "query_file"). If the password
    should not be written to the config file, it is queried when
    needed.
    Yale can now directly work on databases without copying the data
    to memory first (alpha version!!!). If this behavior is desired,
    the parameter "work_on_databases" must be set to true and the
    parameter "table_name" must be the name of an existing table. Be
    careful with this option since it will change the database.

  * FeatureGeneration: New parameter list "functions" allows 
    specification of attribute generation and selection in config
    file. Was formerly specified in separate file (still working).

  * ExampleSetWriter: Output in sparse format and arbitrary user 
    defined format now possible.

  * PerformanceEvaluator: "comparator_class" allows for user defined
    comparators of performance measures

  * Performance criteria measure micro and makro average and variance.

  * Special "id" attribute now supported (<id> tag in attribute
    description files).

  * Memory of unused attributes (e.g. intermediately generated
    attributes, predicted labels in crossvalidations) freed.

  * Weka models can now be displayed graphically.

  * Implementation details:
    - JUnit tests added
    - UserError introduced and exception handling improved.
    - Refactoring eases extensibility for user defined 
      custom operators.
    - Tutorial operator description automatically generated 
      from the JavaDoc comments in the operator source code 
      and the operator self description.


Changes from Yale 1.0 to Yale 2.0 beta [2003/03/12]
---------------------------------------------------

  * Graphical User Interface (GUI) added.

  * Configuration file '~/.yalerc' moved to '~/.yale/yalerc', 
    together with some other configuration files.

  * Root operators (= outer most operators) in experiments 
    must now be of class "Experiment".

  * The "group" attribute of the <parameter> tags was replaced by the
    <list> tag, e.g.:
        <list>
          <parameter key="key1" value="value1"/>
	  ...
          <parameter key="keyN" value="valueN"/>
        </list>

  * All model applier operators were replaced by a single
    "ModelApplier" operator for all models.

  * The "parentlookup" attribute of <operator> tags is obsolete.

  * The operator "SVMLearner" was renamed to "MySVMLearner"
    (because Yale does not only support the mySVM by Stefan Rueping
    as the only SVM implementation, but also supports the implementations
    SVM^light by Thorsten Joachims and LibSVM by Chih-Chung Chang and 
    Chih-Jen Lin).

  * Some parameters were renamed (which can be easily checked in the GUI).
      - PerformanceEvaluator: 'criteria_list' replaced by boolean parameters
       - Experiment:          'tmp_dir' renamed to 'temp_dir'

Release of Yale 1.0 [2002/06/19]
--------------------------------

  * Initial public release of the machine learning environment Yale
    (Yet Another Learning Environment).
