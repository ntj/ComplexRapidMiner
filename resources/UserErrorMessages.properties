error.101.name  = Non-nominal label
error.101.short = The label attribute ({1}) must be nominal for {0}.
error.101.long  = Certain learning schemes and algorithms require the label attribute to be nominal. In that case we say that the learning task is classification. Decision trees (ID3, J48, C4.5) are an example of classification learners.

error.102.name  = Non-numerical label
error.102.short = The label attribute ({1}) must be numerical for {0}.
error.102.long  = Certain learning schemes and algorithms require the label attribute to be numerical. In that case we say that the learning task is regression.

error.103.name  = Non-nominal attribute
error.103.short = The example set contains non-nominal attribute {1} which is not allowed for {0}.
error.103.long  = Some learning schemes and algorithms can handle only nominal attributes. Numerical values can be discretized (e.g. to 'small', 'medium', 'large') in a preprocessing step.

error.104.name  = Non-numerical attribute
error.104.short = The example set contains non-numerical attribute {1} which is not allowed for {0}.

error.105.short = Input example set does not have a label attribute
error.105.long  = Many operators like classification and regression methods or the PerformancEvaluator require the input example sets to have a label or class attribute. If this not the case, applying these operators is pointless. If you read the data using an ExampleSource, you can specify the label attribute by using a 'label' tag in the attribute description file.

error.106.name  = Missing attributes
error.106.short = Input example set has no attributes
error.106.long  = Learning methods require the input example sets to have at least one attribute. If this not the case, applying these operators is pointless. Certain operators like feature selection operators may switch off all attributes. If this happens, learning schemes cannot be applied.

error.114.long  = Some operators only work for binominal labels, e.g. most SVM implementations. If you have more than two different values you can merge them during preprocessing. You can also use the meta learner Binary2MultiClass If the label is numerical you might want to discretize it first.

error.115.name  = Cannot create predicted label
error.115.short = A predicted label cannot be created since no label is defined
error.115.long  = Predicted labels are created with value type equal to the value type of the true label. Hence, this is only possible if the label is defined. If you want to label unlabelled data, use a <label> tag in the attribute description file with sourcecol=none!

error.129.short = Input example set does not have an id attribute
error.129.long  = Many operators like clustering methods require the input example sets to have an id attribute. If this not the case, applying these operators will not work. If you read the data using an ExampleSource, you can specify the id attribute by using a 'id' tag in the attribute description file. Alternatively you can simply use the IDTagging operator.

error.130.name  = Missing example for ID
error.130.short = The input example set does not contain an example with id {0}

error.136.short = The operator is not able to work on the attribute {0}.
error.136.long  = The operator tries to work on a user specified attribute which is not suitable for this purpose, e.g. the operator tries to calculate the sum of all values for a nominal attribute - which is of course not possible.
