      <description text="#ylt#p#ygt#For most data formats the default parameters of the ExampleSource operator should do the job. However, there might be some special text based format which are not supported by any of the standard data input operators provided by RapidMiner. In these cases, often a small change of one of the parameters of the ExampleSource operators is enough in order to allow for these more unusual data formats: changing the parameter #yquot#column_separator#yquot# of the operator #yquot#ExampleSource#yquot# is often sufficient.#ylt#/p#ygt##ylt#p#ygt#This parameter is defined by a regular expression which turns the ExampleSource operator into a very powerful input source since basically all formats can be defined by means of regular expressions. The default parameter value is #yquot#,?\s|;?\s|,|;#yquot# which means that each whitespace, each semicolon, or comma is handled as colomn separator (followed by an arbitrary number of whitespace). In this experiment, this parameter must have been changed to #yquot#(\s)+#yquot# indicating that at least one (but also more than one!) whitespace character separates the columns. Please refer to the description of regular expressions for Java for more information.#ylt#/p#ygt##ylt#p#ygt#Again, the easiest way of defining the parameters of the ExampleSource operator (including the column seperator) is to use the configuration wizard which is started by pressing the button at the top of the parameter table.#ylt#/p#ygt#"/>
