<operator name="Root" class="Process">
    <description text="#ylt#p#ygt#This learner creates a neural network allowing numerical predictions for 
the loaded data set. RapidMiner provides an operator NeuralNet which can be used 
to learn such a network. Please check the parameters of this operator 
(tool tip text after holding the mouse pointer a few seconds above the 
parameter) for further information about the parameters.#ylt#/p#ygt#

#ylt#p#ygt#After this experiment was finished the model is shown which represents 
the learned neural network. The connections between nodes are painted
darker if the connection weight is high. You can click on a node in this
visualization in order to see the actual weights.#ylt#/p#ygt#"/>
