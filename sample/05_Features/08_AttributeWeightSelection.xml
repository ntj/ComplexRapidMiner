      <description text="#ylt#p#ygt# A simple and usually fast possibility to perform feature selection is to first calculate attribute weights from the given data set (in this experiment: RelieF) and to apply an AttributeWeightSelection operator afterwards. This operator deselects all features not fulfilling a given weight relation. #ylt#/p#ygt# #ylt#p#ygt#This is usually referred to as #yquot#filter approach#yquot# since no other information than the data set is used. If the performance of a specific learner should be taken into account we refer to this as #yquot#wrapper approach#yquot#. The next sample experiments give examples for different wrapper approaches for feature weighting, selection, and construction.#ylt#/p#ygt#"/>
